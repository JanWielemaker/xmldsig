# Implement XMLDSIG for SWI-Prolog

Prototype implementation for XML digital signatures.

  - Currently only implements signing, no verification
  - Requires current GIT version of [swipl-devel](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel)
  - Requires [c14n2](https://github.com/JanWielemaker/c14n2).

The ultimate goal of these libraries  is   to  implement  SAML. When the
prototype implementation is stable it will be repackaged.
